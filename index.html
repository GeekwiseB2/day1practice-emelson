        <h3>I'm here to find a passion for something creative.  I'm very interested in technology and how to use it in my current classroom.  Learning to design websites will help me to reach my students and their families better in the short term.  In the long term, learning to design websites will hopefully help me find meaning within something creative and lead to getting out of the teaching profession.</h3>
